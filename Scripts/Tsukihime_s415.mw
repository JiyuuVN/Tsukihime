`"Well, Nii-san.@ Please go to sleep for tonight."@
` Akiha speaks in a very gentle tone.@

` But, to sleep...
` I'm afraid that if I sleep, I'll see that nightmare.@

`"No, I---"@
`"Please, Nii-san.@ Didn't you say you'll listen to what I say, just for today...?"@
` Akiha's eyes are pleading.@
` ...... From the bottom of her heart, Akiha is really worried about me.\

`"Alright.@ I'll sleep quietly."@
`"...... Yes.@ Thank you."@
`"Silly.@ why are you thanking me?@ I should be the one thanking you."@
` ...... I.@
` Even though I neglected you for eight years, you're the one who called me back to this mansion.\

`"---Akiha.@ I'm, sorry for everything.@ I'm selfish, and never thought about you.@ But, from now on..."@
`"It's fine.@ Please stay as you are, Nii-san.@
` And, I should be the one who's apologizing.@ Please, don't apologize to me.@ If you do, I'll feel like a really horrible person."\

` Akiha grasps my hand, tears welling in her eyes.@
` ...... I don't understand.@
` Why Akiha is saying such things.@
` Why she keeps repeating "I'm sorry".\

`"...... I'm, getting tired.@ I'll... sleep for a bit."@
`"---Yes.@ Good night, Nii-san."\
