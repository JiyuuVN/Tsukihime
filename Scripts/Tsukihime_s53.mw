`"Shiki-sama, it is morning.@ Please wake up."@
br
` ...... I hear a familiar voice.\
br
`"Shiki-sama...... Please wake up.@ If you are late like yesterday, you will break your promise with Akiha-sama."@
br
` ...... A voice partly tense, partly relaxed.\

`"Shiki-sama.@ Is it okay?@ Akiha-sama will end up scolding you again."@
br
` ...... No, it's not okay at all.@
br
`"...... I'm up.@ I'm up, so hold on."@
` Still under the sheets, I respond as I slowly open my eyes.\

`"Good morning, Shiki-sama."@
`"Ah, mornin'."@
` I give a sleepy greeting in response and put on my glasses.@
` It's past seven in the morning.@
` Hisui came at her usual time and managed to wake me.@

`"I will prepare your breakfast.@ After changing, please head towards the dining room."@

` Hisui disappears from the room after a bow.\

` I give a big yawn.@
` After a nice stretch, I get up from bed.@
` I change into my school uniform and cast a glance at my desk.@
` ...... On top is the knife I will not ever use again.\

` The curtains sway in the wind.@
` Hisui must have opened the window; the sky is refreshingly clear.@
` It's just a little cold, though.@
br
` I approach the window to close it.\

` ---As it turned out,
` I ended up waking in my own room.\

` It seems Senpai carried me here.@ Fortunately, Akiha and the others didn't know I left.@
` It's been one week since that night.@
` Tohno Shiki's life hasn't changed a bit from what it was before.\

` My relationship with Akiha is a bit uneasy at times, but of course we're brother and sister.@
` Except for that passageway being repaired, the school has not changed at all.@
br
` ...... No, it did change.@
` At school, there's no senpai called Ciel anywhere, nor does anyone remember her.@
` The instances of serial murders haven't occurred once since then.@ Since there's been no official arrest, the city streets are still relatively empty at night, but it'll probably return to normal in a month.\

` As for me,
` I carry an unfillable void in my heart, but I continue on as I did before.@
` ...... or rather, I can bear it all.@
` At times, I get overwhelmed when I am assailed by memories, but I don't think I'll go insane or anything for now.@
br
` Some day.@
` Will I go crazy after not being able to bear these memories, or will I just return to living normally after getting used to them?\

` Perhaps it's about a fifty-fifty chance.@
` ---But until then,
` even if it is a little girlish, I keep the final promise I made with her everyday.@
br
`"----Autumn is drawing to a close, isn't it?"@
br
` The blue sky outside is enough to take my breath away.@
` Taking a large, deep breath, I shut the window.\
